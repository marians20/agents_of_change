**Solution**:
```powershell
# Verify database exists
Test-Path "d:\work\poc\Agents of Change\Demos\AskLISA.Blazor\wwwroot\nasdaq.db"

# If false, copy the file
Copy-Item "d:\work\poc\Agents of Change\Demos\Ask LISA\static\nasdaq.db" "d:\work\poc\Agents of Change\Demos\AskLISA.Blazor\wwwroot\nasdaq.db"
```

### API Key Invalid
**Error**: "401 Unauthorized" or "Invalid API key"

**Solution**:
- Verify API key is correct in `appsettings.Development.json`
- Check for extra spaces or quotes
- Ensure key has proper permissions
- For Azure: Verify endpoint URL format

### Port Already in Use
